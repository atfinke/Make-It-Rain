# Make It Rain

In the fall, I let people control my Nanoleaf Aurora lights on my dorm room window from outside [[client](https://github.com/atfinke/Dorm-Room-Client), [server](https://github.com/atfinke/Dorm-Room-Server)], after having wanted to replicate the [Panic Sign](https://sign.panic.com) since it first went up.

For the spring, I needed to top that, so I decided I wanted to have water fly out my dorm room window on command, as I've loved the idea of creating something interactive with water (my favorite show ever is [World of Color](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goV829uUXog)). This is how I did it for < $20,000.

## Future Work

Yeezy prophesied "no one man should have all that power". Aware of this, I had briefly started work on the ability for anyone to remotely control the fountain from my website (like my lights). Not sure if I'll have a chance to finish it before the [summer](https://www.andrewfinke.com/apple).
